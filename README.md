<h2>Progressive Data Structure and Algorithm Implementation Journey</h2>
<br>
This comprehensive journey begins with fundamental data structures: singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and their circular variants. We then move to stack and queue structures implemented with both arrays and linked lists. The foundation laid, we explore more complex data structures: AVL trees, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval, and binary heaps for priority-based operations.
<br>
Hashing techniques with various collision resolution methods follow, utilizing different data structures. We proceed with tree structures, including basic tree operations and binary search trees (BST). As prerequisites, these structures prepare us for advanced data handling.
<br>
The journey continues with trie data structures and retrieval systems, building upon previous knowledge. Then, we introduce graph data structures implemented using adjacency lists and matrices. These involve core data structures like queues, stacks, and linked lists.
<br>
We delve into graph algorithms, implementing BFS and DFS, vital for understanding undirected graph topological sorting and single-source shortest path calculation using BFS. Then, we tackle complex algorithms, implementing Dijkstra's and Floyd-Warshall's algorithms with the assistance of priority queues and linked lists.
<br>
Finally, we confront interview questions and algorithms, employing core data structures like disjoint sets, Kruskal's, and Prim's algorithms. This progressive journey ensures a logical, informed, and well-rounded understanding of data structures and algorithms.
